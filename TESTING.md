## **Functionality Testing**

My first checks were to test the usability of my website. I manually checked all internal links to see if they worked as intended. I also checked all external links to make sure that they were linked to the correct place and that they opened in a separate tab. 

I then checked the forms to make sure that they worked correctly. Both forms worked as expected and would not let you submit without the correct information.

I also checked to make sure that the site was responsive. I checked each page using developer tools on Google Chrome to check the break points and checked it against multiple emulated devices. 

I also checked the site on multiple browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) to ensure that my site works on accross different browsers and it was responsive on all three. Finally I tested the site on my phone to ensure that it was responsive on smaller screens. 

## **Code Validation**

I ran the html code through the W3C html validator to make sure that there weren't any issues with the code. It flagged up some issues that were corrected in commits cee9f5 and c8c9ce. I then ran it through the validator again and it passed.

## **Performance**

Lighthouse in chrome developer tools was used to assess the performance of the page. The top image shows the desktop performance of the home page, while the bottom image shows its mobile performance. I also checked all other pages and they got the same, if not a better, score.
